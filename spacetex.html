    <span>SpaceTex is a JavaScript typing game for the math language TeX. With a dynamic space theme, the goal is to destroy
        as
        many asteroids, that contain the TeX math symbols, as possible. It was created using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
        The
        animations come from the native requestAnimationFrame method as well as regular HTML DOM manipulation.</span>
