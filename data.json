I came across your job posting and wanted to speak to you about your Software Engineering role. I believe that throughout my college career Iâ€™ve had many opportunities through academic courses and work experiences that would allow me to project success in this position.",
        "bio_2": "Last summer, I had the opportunity to work as a <strong>Software Developer Intern for IDeaS Revenue Management Solutions,</strong> a subsidiary of SAS Analytics. In collaboration with my team, we built a state-of-the-art revenue management system for one of the largest hotel chains in the United States: Wyndham Garden Hotels. I developed several frontend components for the platform using Angular.js and old-fashioned Javascript and worked closely with the design team to help make user experience and user interface decisions. After implementing many of the designs, I worked with our backend team to update different API endpoints and connect the application to our various microservices. Using SpringBoot, I had the opportunity to create, edit, and delete various endpoints, modifying nearly 10,000+ properties in our database."

The animations come from the native requestAnimationFrame method as well as regular HTML DOM manipulation."
